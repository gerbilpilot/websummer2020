	<p>Welcome to Axel, the best dog in the world. This is a website all about my dog and how awesome he is.</p><br>
	<p>Axel is a golden doodle (golden retriever and poodle) and he is from Wisconsin, Green bay. He loves to carry socks around in his mouth and jump up on the table and eat my dinner. He also likes playing with his friend <a href="kunuc.html">Kunuc</a>. 
<br>Here are some pictures of him.</p>
