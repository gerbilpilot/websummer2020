<p> Marshmallow has a lot of nick names some of them are Bobby, Marshy, and sweetie pie. He loves to go on the river, play with his friends, and take walks. In the winter he loves to play in the snow, but sometimes on walks his feet hurt from the salt and cold, so we carry him or turn around and go home.</p>





<p>Marshmallows favorite thing to eat is peanut butter and Django likes cheese. Here are some other foods they like:</p>


<ul>


<li>meat</li> 


<li>salmon</li> 


<li>ice cream</li>


<p> Marshmallow has fallen in a pool a few times. Once he fell in our hot tub in Florida, but got himself out on his own. He prefers rivers over pools because he can go in on his own terms and at his own pace, but in pools he has to go in one step at a time. The river that we take him and his brother on is the St.Croix River on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin. It connects to the Mississippi River as well.</p>
