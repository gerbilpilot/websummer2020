        <h1>Django Rose</h1>

<p> Django rose is an adorable rescue who is afraid of bugs. He has a younger brother named Marshmallow(who is a Pug.). We call Django a Fun Cop because he barks and barks when his younger brother is playing with other dogs.</p>

<p> Django plays a game around our pool with me. We don't have a name for it, but I can tell you a little bit about it. I run around the pool wile Django and Marshy chase me. When they get close I jump in the pool. The diving board is a safe zone. We can not play it to many times in a row other wise his paws will get soar and bloody.</p> 

<p>I hope you enjoyed learning about Django. Here is his cute picture!
