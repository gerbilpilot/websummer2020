	<p> Hi, my name is Josephine Jean MacDonald and I live in Stillwater, MN. I live with my parents and two dogs. I also have a brother and a sister, but they are a lot older then me, so they don't live with us any more. We travel to Florida alot. I go to school at Mounds Park Academy in St. Paul, MN with my BFFs Julia and Audrey. I am on a competitive swim team called St. Croix Swim Club. My dog's  names are Django and Marshmallow. One of them is a mix ant the other is a pug. They are super adorable. I hope you have enjoyed learning about my family and I. Here is a picture of my pug and I on my Birthday. </p>
